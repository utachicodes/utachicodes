## Hi there 🦇 I'm Abdoullah Ndao but most people know me as utachi.
I'm a data scientist based in Senegal, passionate about turning bold design ideas into fast, accessible, and intuitive interfaces.

When I’m not deep in code or fighting bugs, you’ll find me writing poetry, exploring marine biology, hitting the gym, or cooking up something new. I also enjoy teaching, writing blog posts.

Fun facts:
I do drink coffee and tea ☕

Sharks > everything 🦈

Transformers still reigns supreme 🎴🔥
